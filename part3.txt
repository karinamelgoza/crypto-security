In 2011, Sony Pictures was hacked by LulzSec. 1 million user accounts were compromised, which inlcluded passwords, usernames, emails and DOBs. The group LulzSec's press release states they used sql injection to access the data. Their press release also stated that Sony's data was not encrypted and passwords were stored in plaintext. The attack was part of series of attacks the group was doing during that time. Since then Sony has started to encrypt data and are monitoring atypical login patterns.
